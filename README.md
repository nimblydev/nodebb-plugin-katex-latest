# nodebb-plugin-katex-latest

Just a leaner version of `nodebb-plugin-katex` with no admin pannel or options whatsoever..
and a focus at keeping in sync with the latest (stable) version of Katex, which is currently the [v0.8.3](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/releases/tag/v0.8.3)

## Syntax
the usual LaTeX syntax for inline math expression is to surround your maths with `$` like this : `I'm speaking maths : $E = MC^2$`
